# TypeScript Webpack template

This is a template with simple defaults for Webpack and TypeScript for quickly getting started with projects.

The project is preconfigured for development for the browser, not node.

Further enhancements like linting, editorconfig, etc. will be added later.

# Usage

Install dependencies

`npm install`

Write code in the `src` folder.

Build

`npm run build`
